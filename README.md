# Slack

## Synopsis
Various ways of posting alerts to Slack.

## Motivation
For various robots and other processes, I wanted a simple way to receive alerts when something bad happened or something completed.  E-mail can be cumbersome, and because I get it on my phone, alerts may blend in with all the other stuff I get. Slack helps important alerts stand out more, and they're easier to scan through on a small screen.

## Project items
This project is intended to contain multiple methods of posting an alert to Slack.  The following methods are included so far:
* bash

## Why bother?
So I (and now you!) can get alerts on your phone when something goes wrong or when one of your processes just wants to talk:
